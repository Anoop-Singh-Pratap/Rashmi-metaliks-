# üîí Security Audit Report - Rashmi Metaliks Website

**Date:** $(date)  
**Auditor:** AI Security Assistant  
**Status:** ‚úÖ MAJOR SECURITY ISSUES RESOLVED

## üö® Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Hardcoded Credentials Removed ‚úÖ
- **Issue:** Exposed API tokens, passwords, and keys in environment files
- **Fix:** 
  - Removed hardcoded CMS API token from `backend/.env`
  - Removed hardcoded reCAPTCHA secret key
  - Removed hardcoded email credentials from `emailService.ts`
  - Added proper environment variable validation
- **Impact:** Prevents credential theft and unauthorized access

### 2. Enhanced Input Validation & Sanitization ‚úÖ
- **Issue:** Basic validation with potential for injection attacks
- **Fix:**
  - Implemented comprehensive Joi validation schemas
  - Added input sanitization middleware
  - Enhanced email and phone number validation
  - Added XSS protection through input cleaning
- **Impact:** Prevents XSS, injection attacks, and malformed data

### 3. Secure Reference ID Generation ‚úÖ
- **Issue:** Predictable timestamp-based reference IDs
- **Fix:**
  - Replaced timestamp-based IDs with UUID-based secure IDs
  - Applied to contact forms, vendor registration, and job applications
- **Impact:** Prevents ID enumeration attacks

### 4. Enhanced Security Headers ‚úÖ
- **Issue:** Basic Helmet.js configuration
- **Fix:**
  - Comprehensive Content Security Policy (CSP)
  - HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
  - X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options
  - Referrer Policy and Permissions Policy
- **Impact:** Protects against clickjacking, XSS, and other client-side attacks

### 5. Rate Limiting Implementation ‚úÖ
- **Issue:** No protection against abuse and DoS attacks
- **Fix:**
  - General rate limiting: 100 requests per 15 minutes
  - Strict rate limiting for sensitive endpoints: 5 requests per 15 minutes
  - Applied to contact, vendor, and application endpoints
- **Impact:** Prevents abuse, spam, and DoS attacks

### 6. File Upload Security ‚úÖ
- **Issue:** Unrestricted file uploads
- **Fix:**
  - File type validation (PDF, DOC, DOCX, JPG, PNG only)
  - File size limits (5MB for resumes, 10MB for vendor docs)
  - MIME type verification
  - Extension validation
- **Impact:** Prevents malicious file uploads and storage abuse

### 7. HTTPS Enforcement ‚úÖ
- **Issue:** No HTTPS redirect in production
- **Fix:**
  - Added automatic HTTPS redirect middleware for production
  - HSTS headers for browser enforcement
- **Impact:** Ensures encrypted communication

### 8. Enhanced Error Handling ‚úÖ
- **Issue:** Potential information leakage in error messages
- **Fix:**
  - Generic error messages in production
  - Detailed logging for debugging (server-side only)
  - Proper error status codes
- **Impact:** Prevents information disclosure

### 9. Security Monitoring ‚úÖ
- **Issue:** No security event logging
- **Fix:**
  - Suspicious request pattern detection
  - Security event logging
  - Slow request monitoring
- **Impact:** Enables threat detection and response

### 10. Dependency Security ‚úÖ
- **Issue:** Vulnerable dependencies
- **Fix:**
  - Fixed all fixable vulnerabilities via `npm audit fix`
  - Documented remaining third-party vulnerabilities
- **Impact:** Reduces attack surface from known vulnerabilities

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Test Results Prediction

### 1. Vulnerability Scanners (OWASP ZAP/Nikto)
**Expected Results:** ‚úÖ PASS
- Rate limiting prevents automated scanning abuse
- Input validation blocks injection attempts
- Security headers prevent common attacks
- File upload restrictions prevent malicious uploads

### 2. Information Gathering (WhatWeb/Wappalyzer)
**Expected Results:** ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL
- Technology stack will still be visible (React, Node.js)
- Server information headers removed
- Error messages don't leak version info

### 3. SSL & HTTPS Analysis (SSL Labs)
**Expected Results:** ‚úÖ A+ RATING
- HTTPS enforcement in production
- HSTS headers configured
- Strong security headers implemented

### 4. Security Headers (SecurityHeaders.com)
**Expected Results:** ‚úÖ A+ RATING
- Content-Security-Policy: ‚úÖ Implemented
- X-Content-Type-Options: ‚úÖ Implemented  
- X-Frame-Options: ‚úÖ Implemented
- Referrer-Policy: ‚úÖ Implemented
- HSTS: ‚úÖ Implemented
- Permissions-Policy: ‚úÖ Implemented

### 5. Input Validation Testing
**Expected Results:** ‚úÖ PASS
- XSS attempts blocked by sanitization
- SQL injection prevented by validation
- File upload attacks blocked by restrictions
- Rate limiting prevents brute force

## üîß Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables (CRITICAL)
The following environment variables MUST be set with secure values:

```bash
# Backend (.env)
CMS_API_TOKEN=your_secure_strapi_api_token_here
RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=your_recaptcha_secret_key_here
EMAIL_USER=your_email@rashmigroup.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_secure_email_password_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
```

### Production Deployment Checklist
- [ ] All environment variables set with secure values
- [ ] HTTPS certificate configured
- [ ] Firewall rules configured
- [ ] Regular security updates scheduled
- [ ] Log monitoring configured
- [ ] Backup and recovery tested

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Considerations

### Third-Party Vulnerabilities
The following vulnerabilities exist in third-party packages and require monitoring:
- `esbuild` (moderate): Development server vulnerability
- `lodash.template` (high): Command injection in aceternity-ui
- `pdfjs-dist` (high): PDF.js vulnerability in @types/react-pdf

**Mitigation:** These are development dependencies or unused features. Monitor for updates.

### Ongoing Security Measures
1. **Regular Updates:** Schedule monthly dependency updates
2. **Security Monitoring:** Monitor logs for suspicious activity
3. **Token Rotation:** Rotate API tokens every 90 days
4. **Security Audits:** Quarterly security reviews
5. **Penetration Testing:** Annual professional security testing
